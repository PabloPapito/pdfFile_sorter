# pdfFile_sorter
This program is used to verify the contents of PDF files. If a file does not contain exactly three (3) pages, the program will move that file to a subfolder named "2pages" and delete the original version of the file from the main folder.  I wrote the program in Python programming language and used the PyPDF2 library to manipulate PDF files.
